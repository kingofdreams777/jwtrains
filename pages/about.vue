                <h1>I received my first Lionel Train set</h1>
                <p> for Christmas in 1953 when I was eight years old. <em>(I'll let you
                        figure out how old I am now!)</em> It was revered and played with for several years until higher
                    priority things held my interest; like school, cars, etc. Fortunately, my train was kept in the family
                    and I
                    regained possession when I married.</p>

                <p> and we gave our son my train for his seventh birthday. I was interested in doing some
                    minor
                    repair on the locomotive and was introduced to some very knowledgeable people through the local train
                    club
                    here in San Diego
                    <em>(The All Gauge Toy Train Association)</em> where I learned about model trains. I
                    started buying used items that needed repair and found I enjoyed taking things apart to see how they
                    worked.
                <blockquote class="text-white">
                    <em>Undoubtedly a personality trait carried over from childhood. My father never did forgive me for
                        disassembling his electric drill.</em>
                </blockquote>
                I thought I should start documenting the repairs and that
                progressed to writing helpful repair hints for the club's newsletter. I became friends with the owner of
                the
                local hobby shop where I would buy old cabooses and used 0-27 track. I offered to be their repairman; it
                worked out well for all parties.

                <p>Since I was a member of the Toy Train Operating Society, Southern Pacific Division, in Los Angeles, I
                    began
                    writing repair hints for their newsletter, the Daylighter. Soon, I was writing longer and more detailed
                    articles for maintenance and repair of differenting operating cars, accessories, transformers,
                    locomotives,
                    and tenders.</p>

                <p>I met Dave Otth through the TTOS and found we had a mutual interest in the production of videos for the
                    repair of Lionel Model Trains. A partnership was formed where Dave produced the videos and I repaired
                    trains
                    in the studio. Together, we produced four videos from 1989 to 1991, volumes 1-3 are 60 minutes each and
                    volume 4 is 30 minutes.</p>

                <p>My writing and the videos attracted the interest of Dick Christianson, the then editor of the Classic Toy
                    Trains magazine. He offered me the opportunity to take over the Questions and Answers column for the
                    magazine which I did from 1993 to July of 1999.</p>

                <p>I've been working on the internet since it first became practical in the early 1980's. It finally evolved
                    to
                    a technology that offered unlimited opportunities for information dissemination and that interested me
                    since
                    I've always like to share my hobby. That led to creating this site for those interested in fixing and
                    maintaining toy trains. </p>

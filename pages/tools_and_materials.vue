                <h1>Tools and Materials That You Will Need to Repair Model Trains</h1>
                <p>I have, in the past several years, accumulated a cadre of tools and materials that I consider essential
                    to
                    maintaining and repairing model electric trains. They are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Repair manual for postwar Lionel electric trains (Greenberg and K-line are two distributors)</li>
                    <li>Pencil tipped soldering iron (typical soldering station is around 50 watts but develop 700-800
                        degrees
                        tip temperature) 1/16 inch diameter solder for electrical circuits.</li>
                    <li>Soft towel or piece of plush carpet to cushion the cars and engines as you work on them. Some people
                        have made a U-shaped padded enclosure to hold locomotives upside down while working on the wheels or
                        pickups.</li>
                    <li>Small phillips head screwdriver</li>
                    <li>Small flat blade screwdriver</li>
                    <li>Split-end screwdriver (for holding and starting small machine screws in those hard to get at places)
                    </li>
                    <li>Small needle-nosed pliers</li>

                    <li>Small hammer (8 ounce ball peen is nice)</li>
                    <li>Outside pliers for spreading loco frames</li>
                    <li>Electric drill with various bits</li>

                    <li>Lionel "E" unit tool (ST-303)</li>
                    <li>Mild soap (Ivory is good for plastic shell cleaning)</li>

                    <li>Small stiff wire brush (brass is best)</li>
                    <li>Ink eraser (pencil style) to buff armatures and contacts</li>
                    <li>Light weight machine oil and needle applicator</li>
                    <li>Light weight grease for gears and armature shafts (Lubriplate 630-AA)</li>
                    <li>WD 40 for cleaning metal and black painted shells, boilers, frames, and chassis)</li>
                    <li>Tuner cleaner (safe for plastics) for degreasing axles, iron core plungers, roller pickups.</li>

                <h2>General notes on your work area:</h2>
                <p>
                    Good lighting is a must!!! Plenty of light right on the job will save you frustration because you can
                    see
                    what
                    you're doing and also what might be wrong inside the unit under repair. A strong surface such as a work
                    bench or
                    sturdy table is important. A card table is too flimsy except for occasional projects. The correct height
                    chair if
                    you like to sit or a high table if you prefer to stand is important for comfort and no stress on the
                    back.
                    Many
                    repair jobs take several hours of concentrated effort and you don't want to get tired halfway through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good ventilation. There are times when soldering will produce noxious fumes that may irritate your eyes
                    or
                    nose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have a pencil and paper handy to make sketches of wiring or the way something goes together. You may not
                    get
                    around
                    to finishing the job right away and the memory can't always be trusted. Also make a list of repair parts
                    you
                    need as
                    you proceed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Find a source of repair parts and a knowledgeable person who can advise you when things get tough and
                    you
                    need a
                    part to get that locomotive back on line. There are many good reproduction parts available to replace
                    worn
                    or lost
                    original pieces. Don't use the wrong screw even temporarily because it may ruin the threads for future
                    use
                    of the
                    correct part.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Have access to a small child with eagle eyes to find those teeny parts that always fall on the floor at
                    the
                    wrong
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are, undoubtedly, specialized tools that I have omitted or something you consider indispensable.
                    However, I
                    can safely state, if you have all of the above tools and materials, you can maintain and repair most of
                    your
                    engines, cars, and accessories.
